report: Regression Analysis on New York City Airbnb Open Data
reportref:
description: Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has become one of the world’s largest marketplaces to connect people who want to rent out their homes with travelers. The price of one night’s rent at an Airbnb property can vary wildly based on factors such as location, reviews, and amenities. This project attempts to determine which factors have the most impact on the final listed price. The data exploration, mathematical regression models, and implementations in R, as well as solutions and comments on the applications are included.
