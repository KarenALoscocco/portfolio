description: This paper examines two well-known variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP): the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). VRPs are used in a variety of applications which motivate research in both industry and academia. Two approaches to solve both of these problems are explored: a flow based approach and a set partitioning approach using column generation and a corresponding pricing problem. The model formulations, implementations in Gurobi Python, as well as solutions and comments on the scalability of the approaches are included.
